If you’ve deployed your application using `chalice deploy`, 
you can test the REST API by making requests to the Rest API URL, shown in the output of `chalice deploy`, 
in our example that would be https://abcd.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/api/. 
If you’re using `chalice local`, you’ll make requests to http://localhost:8000/
